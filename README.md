# The goal was to solve a word Sudoku puzzle using a Constraint Satisfaction Problem Backtracking approach. The Word Sudoku involves given a word bank, insert all the words into the puzzle where each row, column, and 3x3 box cannot have duplicate letters

# To use this algorithm, run the word_sudoku.py file. You can either run a default case or you could provide your own text files names of a valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle text file name and a valid word bank text file. The algorithm will then solve the puzzle.
