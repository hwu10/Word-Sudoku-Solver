# The goal was to solve a word Sudoku puzzle using a Constraint Satisfaction Problem Backtracking approach. The Word Sudoku involves given a word bank, insert all the words into the puzzle where each row, column, and 3x3 box cannot have duplicate letters

# To use this algorithm, download word_sudoku.py to a local directory. If you are trying to pass in your own word sudoku puzzle and word bank, add the files to the same local directory. The run the word_sudoku.py file. You will have the option to choose between running a default puzzle or providing the filenames of the valid word sudoku puzzle and bank text files in the local directory. The algorithm will then proceed to solve the puzzle.
